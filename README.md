### 🚀 **How It Works** 🚀

1. **Movie Search**:
   - Users can search for movies by typing a keyword (e.g., title, genre, actor) in the search bar. The app sends the query to an API, fetches relevant results, and displays them in a grid or list format.
   - Each movie display includes a brief description, poster image, and rating, with an option to view more details.

2. **Saving Favorites**:
   - Users can click a “heart” icon next to each movie to add it to their **Favorites** list.
   - Movies are saved in the browser's **localStorage**, ensuring that the favorites list is persistent even when the page is refreshed or the app is revisited at a later time.

3. **View Favorite Movies**:
   - Users can access their **Favorite Movies** through a separate section of the dashboard, where all previously saved movies are displayed.
   - The app uses **localStorage** to load and display these movies when the user returns.

4. **Responsive Layout**:
   - The **dashboard** adjusts automatically to the screen size, ensuring a fluid layout on both desktop and mobile devices. This is achieved using **CSS media queries** and React’s state management to adjust content presentation.
